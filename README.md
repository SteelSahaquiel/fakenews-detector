# Greek Fake News Detector
A web app that detects fake news written in the Greek language.
You can either enter the URL of a news article, or paste the text directly (works better).
This app was developed with the Streamlit and spacy Python libraries. 
The NLP text classifier was trained on a custom dataset, created with fake news
that were collected from the [Ellinika Hoaxes](https://www.ellinikahoaxes.gr/) fact-checking website.
